🐳 Docker Learning Repository


This repository is created to document my journey of learning Docker.

📌 What I'm Doing:

🛠️ Practicing how to containerize different applications.

🚀 Building and pushing Docker images to registries (like Docker Hub).

📝 Keeping track of useful commands and Docker patterns.

📂 Organizing examples from basic to advanced as I progress.

🎯 Learning real-world use cases and optimizing images.

This repository is created to document my journey of learning Docker. As I explore different concepts and techniques, I'll be adding small practice projects, examples, and Dockerfiles here. The goal is to understand how to containerize applications, optimize images, and work with Docker-related tools in real-world scenarios.

I'll also be pushing the valid images I build to Docker Hub, so I can track my progress over time and refer back to working examples whenever needed.

This repository is purely for practice and learning purposes. As I continue, I'll keep adding more advanced use cases and try to follow best practices for building and managing Docker containers.
